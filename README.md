# TelegramText2Latex
Using this for your telegram account you'll be able to edit your message with simple latex: greek variables and some symbols, superscripts and subscripts. It's not very complete yet. 

## Usage
Just follow any instruction as for [pyrogram.Client example](https://docs.pyrogram.org/start/examples/) but use Bot for it instead.
Since it uses some web-scraping (read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for further informations) with pyrogram you need requests and bs4 packages too.
